#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering systematically applies to engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
importance 
Enables the creation of software application and system that power various aspects of modern life including communication and entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Structured Programming (1960s):introduced the concept of breaking down a program into smaller, manageable sections or modules, making software easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

  Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): This approach models software around “objects” rather than actions, allowing for more modular, reusable, and adaptable code.

   Agile Methodology (2000s):A shift towards flexible, iterative development cycles that respond to change, emphasizing collaboration, customer feedback, and continuous improvement.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Gathering: Understanding and documenting what the stakeholders need from the software.

  Design :Planning the software architecture and user interface.

  Implementation:Writing the actual code based on the design.

  Testing:Ensuring the software is free of bugs and meets requirements.

  Deployment: Releasing the software to users.

   Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates to keep the software running smoothly.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall:

  Sequential process where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

  Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change.

   Agile:

Iterative and flexible approach, with continuous feedback and adaptation.

 Ideal for projects where requirements may evolve during development.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer:Writes code, debugs, and works on implementing features.

 Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures the software meets quality standards through testing.

Project Manager:Oversees the project, ensuring it meets deadlines, stays within budget, and aligns with stakeholder expectations.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

   IDEs: Provide a comprehensive environment for software development, including tools for writing, testing, and debugging code. Example: Visual Studio.

VCS: Track changes to the codebase, enabling collaboration and rollback to previous versions if needed. Example: Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges:

  Managing changing requirements.

  Debugging complex issues.

  Ensuring security.

   - Strategies:

     - Use Agile methods for flexible requirement management.

     - Implement systematic debugging processes.

     - Follow security best practices from the start.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing:Tests individual components for correctness.

   - Integration Testing:Ensures that different components work together.

   - System Testing:Tests the complete system for compliance with requirements.

   - Acceptance Testing:Validates the software against user needs and requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refining input queries (prompts) to obtain the desired output from AI models.

   Importance:

   Ensures more accurate, relevant, and useful responses from AI.

   Helps in fine-tuning AI models to specific tasks.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:Tell me about AI.

   Improved Prompt:Explain how AI is used in healthcare, focusing on the benefits and challenges.

   Explanation: The improved prompt is more specific, guiding the AI to provide a detailed and relevant response, avoiding generic information.
